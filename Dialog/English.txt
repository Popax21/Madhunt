        Oh, Hi {+MROSHIRO}!

    [OSHIRO right nervous]
        O-oh.. Hello {+MS_MADELINE}!
    [OSHIRO right sidesuspicious]
        {+thought}You didn't teleport here, right?{+endthought}

    [OSHIRO right normal]
        Anyway, I want to tell you about the {# 96EFFF}{~}{!}Celeste Community Direct{/~}{/!}{#}

    [MADELINE left distracted]
        Um... doesn't everyone know what it is already?

    [OSHIRO right normal]
        Anyway, thanks to {# 339CC7}Touhoe{#} and {# 339CC7}Nyan{#} for organizing this event!

    [MADELINE left peaceful]
        So you're giving credit... I appreciate it

    {trigger 0 Badeline appears}

    [BADELINE right angry]
        {+MADELINE}, why are you still talking to this {~}creep{/~}?

    [MADELINE left surprised]
        {!}Aah!{/!} What are you doing here!?

    [BADELINE right normal]
        I'm just making sure you didn't forget about {# FF9523}{!}Madhunt{!}{#}'s creators.
        {# 339CC7}Popax21{#} is responsible for all the coding, and {# 339CC7}Mateuszkus{#} created the maps
    [BADELINE right scoff]
        {# 339CC7}firelasto{#} originally came up with the idea.

    {trigger 1 Badeline vanishes}

    [OSHIRO left drama]
